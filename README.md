    <b>
      yay!

into beautiful âœ¨
``` html
<p>
  <b>
    hi 
    <i>
      yay!
    </i>
  </b>
</p>
```
With just a touch of
``` javascript
normalize(element, config);
```
Where config is optional, having pleasant defaults, but extendable for your amusement!

## Installation
``` html
<!-- add jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<!-- then normalise -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/amark/normalize@master/normalize.js"></script>
```

## API
Docs coming soon! Peruse the source for now, it is decently tiny, and the built in config explains most of it.
Depends upon the delightful jQuery.
